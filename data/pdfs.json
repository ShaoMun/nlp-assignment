Work, in fact, is actually one of \nthe best things for protecting our mental health, but it can also adversely affect it. \nGood mental health and well-being is not an on-off \nexperience. We can all have days, weeks or months \nwhere we feel resilient, strong and optimistic, \nregardless of events or situations. Often that can \nbe mixed with or shift to a very different set of \nthoughts, feelings and behaviours; or not feeling \nresilient and optimistic in just one or two areas of \nour life.  For about twenty-five per cent of us, that \nmay shift to having a significant impact on how \nwe think, feel and act in many parts of our lives, \nincluding relationships, experiences at work, sense \nof connection to peer groups and our personal sense \nof worth, physical health and motivation. This could \nlead to us developing a mental health condition such \nas anxiety, depression, substance misuse. \nMental health is a positive concept related to the \nsocial and emotional wellbeing of people and \ncommunities.\nThe concept relates to the enjoyment of life, ability \nto cope with stress and sadness, the fulfilment of \ngoals and potential, and a sense of connection to \nothers. Mental health is about wellness rather than \nillness and is not merely the absence of a mental \nhealth condition.\nLike physical health, mental health is not fixed. \nMental health exists on a continuum, or range:  \nfrom positive, healthy functioning at one end \nthrough to severe symptoms of mental health \nconditions at the other.\nA person’s mental health moves back and forth along this range during \ntheir lifetime, in response to different stressors and circumstances. At \nthe green end of the continuum, people are well; showing resilience \nand high levels of wellbeing. Moving into the yellow area, people \nmay start to have difficulty coping. In the orange area, people have \nmore difficulty coping and symptoms may increase in severity and \nfrequency. At the red end of the continuum, people are likely to be \nexperiencing severe symptoms and may be at risk of self-harm or \nsuicide.\nRisk factors and protective factors influence mental health and can \nnudge people back and forth along the continuum. They can be \nindividual or related to family, work or other life circumstances.\nRisk factors may increase the strain on our mental health, while \nprotective factors can counteract these by helping us to stay or \nbecome well. With much of people’s time each day spent at  work, the \nworkplace is a very influential environment when it comes to mental \nhealth and wellbeing.
